As a busy person, I want to drink coffee so that I wake up.

Problem: 
The coffee machine is leaking! Most likely the tube is not attached to the back very well.

Steps to reproduce
  1. Go to the coffee machine on G4, small kitchen
  2. Put a cup in the dispenser
  3. Press to get any coffee
  4. Water should now be dripping from the right side of the machine. Move the microwave for better view.

Expected outcome / suggested solution:
A coffee in my cup.

Questions: 
Q: Does the same problem occur for tea?
A: Yes.
